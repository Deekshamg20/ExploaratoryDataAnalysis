ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis on Social Media Usage
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on survey data about social media usage. With the growing influence of platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok, understanding how people use these platforms is crucial for businesses, researchers, and policymakers. Social media has become an integral part of modern communication, marketing, and even political engagement, making it essential to analyze patterns of usage across different demographics.

The dataset used in this project is primary data collected through surveys from 78 individuals, including friends, family, and classmates. The respondents range in age from 18 to 63 years, with most being students and working professionals. Key survey details include demographics, device preferences, platform choices, time spent, and perceived impacts of social media. Smartphones emerged as the dominant device, while Instagram and WhatsApp were found to be the most popular platforms.

The analysis begins with data inspection and cleaning, including identifying missing values and understanding column data types. It then progresses to univariate analysis, which examines gender and occupation distributions, number of platforms used, average time spent, and perceived impacts (positive, negative, or mixed). Bivariate analysis further explores relationships such as age versus time spent, platform preferences by gender, and the impact of social media on mental health across groups. Multivariate analysis uses correlation heatmaps and pairplots to identify interrelationships among variables.

Additionally, the project employs advanced analysis techniques, such as K-means clustering, to segment users into distinct groups based on their usage behavior. The elbow method is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring meaningful groupings of engagement patterns.

The insights derived from this project reveal meaningful trends in user behavior, highlight demographic differences in platform usage, and provide a foundation for deeper behavioral or predictive analysis. These findings can help marketers design targeted campaigns, developers enhance user experience, and researchers assess the social and psychological impact of social media.
